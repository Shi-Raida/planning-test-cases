# Job Shop scheduling problems

This module contains small Job Shop scheduling problems (4 jobs and 4 machines).

The `valid_problems/` folder contains the problems with the optimal solution, based on the makespan metric.
The `invalid_problems/` folder contains the same problems but with invalid solutions.

The `.jsp` files contain an additional section compared to the standard version (the *Starts* section), which corresponds to the start time of each task for each job.
